      "story": "Tiong Bahru Bakery has been serving our community for over 15 years, bringing fresh artisan bread and pastries to families across Singapore. What started as a small family operation has grown into a beloved neighborhood staple, known for our signature sourdough and French croissants.\n\nThe pandemic hit us hard, and rising rent costs have made it increasingly difficult to keep our doors open. But our passion for baking and serving our loyal customers keeps us going. With your support, we can secure our lease for another year and continue doing what we love - bringing quality baked goods to the community.\n\nEvery donation helps us cover operational costs, pay our dedicated staff, and invest in quality ingredients. We're not just asking for support; we're inviting you to be part of our journey and share in our success.",
